                Gerald Kampel and JÃ¼rgen Wegner develop the first double frequency transceiver, 
                ORTOVOX F2 for searching avalanche victims. Until then all avalanche transceivers
                in use would send and receive in different frequencies (2, 275kHz and 457 kHz). 
                This would often lead to fatal avalanche accidents when victims could not be 
                found quickly enough due to differences in frequency. The F2 can send and receive 
                on both frequencies.
