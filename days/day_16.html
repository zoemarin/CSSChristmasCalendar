                Alpine Ski (アルパイン・スキ一) is an 
                Alpine skiing arcade game, released by 
                Taito in 1981. The player controls a skier, 
                who can move left, right, or increase 
                forward speed. The aim is to maneuver 
                a skier through a downhill ski course, 
                a slalom course, and a ski jumping 
                competition in the shortest time possible.
